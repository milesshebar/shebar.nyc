 		<p class="biotext">LeWitt studied art at Syracuse University and graduated in 1949 with a BFA. He was drafted to serve in the Korean War and got his start making posters for the Special Services. When he completed his time in the military, he moved to New York to study graphic art. He spent a year working in the office of I.M. Pei in 1955, and briefly worked as an illustrator for the then newly-launched <em>Seventeen</em> magazine. He worked as a night watchman and bookseller at the Museum of Modern Art in 1960 and was inspired by the works of Eadward Muybridge and Jasper Johns. He began working with simple shapes - his "structures" - in the mid-1960s.

 		<p class="biotext">In 1968, LeWitt created his first wall drawings for the inaugural exhibition at the Paula Cooper Gallery in New York. He embraced the fact that these would be painted over after the end of the show, and in doing so began creating his most important pieces of conceptual art yet. He would produce a set of arbitrary rules (some specific, some vague) for a given piece of artwork, and the work would be created by a team of assistants, who LeWitt would then credit with the results. He moved to Italy in the late 1970s and it showed clearly in his wall drawings: they begin to move away from simplistic geometric patterns and towards vibrant blocks of color. <br><br>

 		<p class="biotext">Throughout the 1990s, LeWitt's work became more vibrant and heavily saturated and he began using acrylic paint instead of the ink washes he'd been using since his time in Italy. His wall drawings now numbered in the thousands. While the colors grew increasingly random, the concept behind them never changed: each was still created with strict design guidelines. LeWitt died in 2007, but his work lives on. MASS MoCA has a retrospective of his wall drawings on view until 2033, and one of his later pieces is visible at the transfer from the uptown 1 train to the A/C/E at Columbus Circle in New York City.
