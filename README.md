###### v2.1
Personal website built in 2017, originally as a final project for Kenyon's ARTS 391: Web Media class. First site I've ever designed and coded from the ground up. Currently in the process of rewriting the backend and simplifying the code.

## Todo:
- [ ] Transcode .webm videos to optimize delivery for compatible browsers
- [ ] Start serving content over HTTPS before Chrome 68 update
- [ ] Serve Inconsolata with Google Fonts CDN and remove references to unused font Montserrat

## Big Jobs:
- [ ] Remove inline styling
- [ ] update site to Bootstrap 4
- [ ] Minify JS/CSS for faster serving, add build system
- [ ] Rewrite CSS from ground up (the biggest kahuna)
