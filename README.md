Personal website built in 2017 for Kenyon's ARTS 391: Web Media class. First site I've ever designed/coded from the ground up, so please excuse the mess! Currently in the process of rewriting the backend and simplifying the code.  

## Todo:
- [ ] Rewrite CSS from ground up (the biggest kahuna)
- [ ] Link to external sites with HTTPS
- [ ] Add alt tags to all images
- [ ] Remove inline styling wherever possible
- [ ] Leverage browser caching for image content
- [ ] Minify JS/CSS
- [ ] Start serving content over HTTPS before Chrome 68 update
- [ ] Add keywords to meta tags in header
- [ ] Asynchronously load webfonts?
- [x] Update sitemap
