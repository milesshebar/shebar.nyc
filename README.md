Personal website built in 2017, originally as a final project for Kenyon's ARTS 391: Web Media class. First site I've ever designed/coded from the ground up, so please excuse the mess! Currently in the process of rewriting the backend and simplifying the code.  

## Todo:
- [x] Add keywords to meta tags in header
- [x] Leverage browser caching for image content (add expires headers)
- [ ] Remove inline styling wherever possible
- [ ] Minify JS/CSS for faster serving
- [x] Link to external sites with HTTPS
- [x] Add alt tags to images (still must do this for imagegrid)
- [ ] get rid of .html extensions on each page by adding new folder hierarchy
- [ ] update site to Bootstrap 4
- [ ] Optimize images
- [ ] Start serving content over HTTPS before Chrome 68 update
- [x] Beautify code
- [ ] Asynchronously load webfonts?
- [x] add about button to resume page
- [ ] Rewrite CSS from ground up (the biggest kahuna)
