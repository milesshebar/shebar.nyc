        Imagining the academic world without Net Neutrality<br>

        <p>If you were a student studying at a place like Kenyon, or any other institution that could afford to pay a top-tier broadband ISP for premium data packages, then the loss of the FCC's safeguards against Net Neutrality under Title II of the Communications Act of 1934 might not mean much to you. But for people who can't afford to pay top dollar for premium internet, this problem is far more pressing.
        <br><br>
        In these images, I've imagined a scenario of the dangerous waters we're entering given the FCC's current plan to eliminate these safeguards. The loss of Net Neutrality, especially in the academic sphere, has ramifications for everyone. I attempt to show what could happen if nonprofit internet-based organizations like JSTOR had to make the difficult decision to cowtow to companies like Verizon, becoming subsidiaries in order to stay in business and to continue serving up the massive amounts of data that the academic world depends on.</p>
